                <p>Meet Sully, another great young Macnut PP son from Elquest Holsteins! We view this sharp-weighted bull as a logical replacement for Atlanta P who now has limited semen
                    inventory.
                    
                    Another bull from the great “Finesse” maternal line, Sully also brings together the genetics from many other impressive brood cows, including Elk-Lick Charles Ardel, Kamps-Hollow Altitude and Snow-N-Denises Delilah. Sully’s dam is a beautiful young cow who has her best days ahead of her!
                    
                    On the top side of this pedigree, Macnut PP is proving to be a bull who brings consistent results to dairymen in Canada and here in the U.S. They are moderate-size, wonderful udders and so far 85% of his daughters in Canada have scored GP or better.
                    
                    Besides bringing so many of these foundational cow families together, Sully can add value to your genetics with his homozygous polled and A2/A2 traits.</p>

            <p> Rendezvous (pronounced: rondi-voo) Noun: A meeting at an appointed time and place.

                Comestar Outside is a household name in the industry. This Canadian bull saw immense success in his day and joined the elite list of sires who produced and sold over a million units of semen at Semex. Outside daughters generally weren’t stand-out young cows, but proved to be famous for longevity and overall profitability.
                
                Rendezvous’ dam is an wonderful specimen in her own right who looks like 92 points won’t stop her. She’ sired by another Canadian legend, Hanoverhill Raider (Starbuck x Mil-R-Mor Roxette EX), who Pete Heffering considered one of the best bulls he ever bred. We haven’t even talked about this incredible maternal line, with his 2nd dam being the EX-95 Liberty Rae, then Lana Rae. These cows have an amazing track-record for transmitting high type cattle across the globe.
                
                Rendezvous should sire plenty of width and substance.
